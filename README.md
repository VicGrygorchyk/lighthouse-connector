# lighthouse-connector
Connect Google lightouse with other browser automation tools (WebDriver, Puppeteer)

This connector allows to use Lighthouse alongside Selenium, Webdriver-based, Puppeteer or other browser automation tools.
So we can use Selenuium to interact with the web page and use Lighthouse for performance auditing on the same web page.
I.e. we can login to the web app by using Selenium, then we run Lighthouse to measure performance.
